# Jarvis - AI Chatbot

## Description

Jarvis is an AI-powered chatbot that uses the **Orca Model** for natural language processing tasks. This project is built with **Chainlit** and **ctransformers** to handle conversational AI and stream responses. Jarvis can answer user questions while keeping track of the conversation history, making interactions more dynamic and intelligent.

The model used in this project is **Orca Mini 3B**, a pre-trained causal language model hosted on Hugging Face.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Handles user inputs and provides context-aware responses.
- **Streaming Responses**: Utilizes Chainlit for streaming responses in real-time.
- **Customizable**: You can easily modify the prompt or model to suit your own needs.
